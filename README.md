# Export All Tableau Extension

## Introduction
No matter how much you try to convince them, there will always be some users who want to reduce your beautiful Tableau charts to a table of numbers in Excel. So if they're going to do it anyway, you may as well give them a simple, controlled way, generating one Excel workbook and not a bunch of CSVs.

With the Export All extension for Tableau Server you can place a simple button onto your dashboard, choose which sheets & columns are exported, and with one click your users can download a clean & tidy Excel workbook.

## Standard Installation
1. Download the [.trex file](https://exportallextension.theinformationlab.io/download)
2. In your dashboard drag out the 'Extension' object
3. Select 'My Extensions' & open the downloaded ExportAll.trex file
4. Configure which sheets & columns you'd like to export, save changes & close the configuration window
